    Scenario7: You're developing a webpage for an art gallery and need to create a table to display 
               information about various artworks, including the artist's name, artwork title, and price. 
               How would you structure this table using HTML?

    Question: Explain how you would use HTML to create a table that includes columns for artist name, artwork title,
              and price, and populate it with data for three artworks.
