<!-- 
    Scenario3: You're working on an educational website, and you need to create a definition list to explain key terms 
               related to physics. How would you use HTML to create a definition list with multiple terms and their 
               respective definitions?

    Question: Demonstrate the HTML markup for a definition list containing three physics terms and their definitions.

        <dt>Force:
        <dd>In physics, a force is an influence that can cause an object to change its velocity, i.e., to accelerate,
            unless counterbalanced by other forces. The concept of force makes the everyday notion of pushing or pulling
            mathematically precise.</dd>
        </dt>
        <dt>Mass:
        <dd>It is one of the fundamental quantities in Physics and the most basic property of matter. We can define mass
            as the measure of the amount of matter in a body. The SI unit of mass is Kilogram (kg). Note: The mass of a
            body does not change at any time.</dd>
        </dt>
        <dt>Acceleration:
        <dd>Acceleration is defined as. The rate of change of velocity with respect to time. Acceleration is a vector
            quantity as it has both magnitude and direction. It is also the second derivative of position with respect
            to time or it is the first derivative of velocity with respect to time.</dd>
