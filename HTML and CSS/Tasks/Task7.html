    <h1>Welcome to Travel bolg</h1>
    <p>
        Faroe Islands Journey up to Tilbury was uneventful and we arrived about 2.30pm. Parked in JustPark and then got
        an Uber taxi to the docks (£13.50 roughly)<a href="https://www.travelocity.com/" target="_blank">Travelocity</a> Smooth boarding and first impression of the ship was good. Smallish-
        similar to the Holland America ship. 3 pin plug which makes the ship very English although the Captain said
        there were 28 Nationalities aboard! ( whether he was counting the crew as well I don’t know!!) They have ORCA on
        board looking for whales situated on Deck 10<a href="https://www.makemytrip.com/" target="_blank">MakeMyTrip</a> (which has been locked by the Captain every time we have been down)
        otherwise they are on Deck 12. I especially like the Observatory on Deck 14. Anyway, the first two days were
        spent at sea and apart from going through the Pentland Frith <a href="https://www.booking.com/" target="_blank">Booking.com</a>(between Scotland mainland and the Orkneys)
